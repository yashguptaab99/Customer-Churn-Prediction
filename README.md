Customer loss is very closely related with customer loyalty. Today’s economic trend dictates that price cuts are not the only way to build customer loyalty. Accordingly, adding new value added services to the products has become an industry norm to have loyal customers. The main goal of customer lost study is to figure out a customer who will likely be lost and is to calculate cost of obtaining those customers back again.Companies from these sectors often have customer service branches which attempt to win back defecting clients, because recovered long-term customers can be worth much more to a company than newly recruited clients.
